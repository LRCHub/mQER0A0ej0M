[00:00.35] Hey Jude, don't make it bad
[00:06.74] Take a sad song and make it better
[00:13.58] Remember to let her into your heart
[00:18.44] Then you can start to make it better
[00:36.44] 
[00:25.52] Hey Jude, don't be afraid
[00:32.44] You were made to go out and get her
[00:38.91] The minute you let her under your skin
[00:44.08] Then you begin to make it better
[01:00.08] 
[00:52.87] And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
[00:59.32] Don't carry the world upon your shoulders

[02:05.28] You're waiting for someone to perform with
