From the heart of the black country
Well, I was a robber in Boston place
You gathered 'round me with your fun embrace

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And any time you feel the pain
Hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulder
For well you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
She has found you, go out and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better, better, better, better

So let it out and let it in
Hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you
Hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better, better, better, better, better, better
Whoa

Yeah, na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, hey Jude
Yeah, na-na, na-na-na-na, make it, Jude
Na-na-na-na, hey Jude, hey Jude

Yeah, na-na, na-na-na-na, make it, Jude
Na-na-na-na, hey Jude
Yeah, na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, oh, yeah-yeah-yeah

Na-na, na-na-na-na, make it, Jude, yeah
